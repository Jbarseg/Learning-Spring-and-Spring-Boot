# Beans

## **_What is a Bean?_**

**Bean:** In the Spring framework, a bean is an object that is managed by the Spring IoC (Inversion of Control) container. The purpose of the Spring IoC container is to instantiate, configure, and assemble the beans that make up an application. You can define a bean in a Spring configuration file, which can be written in XML, Java, or a combination of the two. A bean definition includes information about the class of the object, any dependencies that the object has, and how the object should be configured. When the Spring IoC container is asked to create the bean, it will use the bean definition to create the object and wire its dependencies together.
