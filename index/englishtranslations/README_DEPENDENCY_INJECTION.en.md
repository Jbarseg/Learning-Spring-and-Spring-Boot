## Dependency Injection

**What is Dependency Injection (D.I)?** It is a design pattern that is often used in conjunction with IoC. Dependency injection involves creating objects in such a way that the amount of code required to create and configure those objects is minimized. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, they are "injected" from the outside. _In short, dependency injection is a way to simplify the creation and configuration of objects in an application, allowing classes to focus on their business logic instead of worrying about creating their dependencies._
