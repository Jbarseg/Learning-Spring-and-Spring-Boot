## Creating our first Dynamic Web Application with MVC

**What is MVC?** It is a design pattern that is often used in conjunction with IoC. Dependency injection involves creating objects in such a way that the amount of code required to create and configure those objects is minimized. Instead of a class creating its own dependencies, they are "injected" from the outside. _In short, dependency injection is a way to simplify the creation and configuration of objects in an application, allowing classes to focus on their business logic instead of worrying about creating their dependencies._

### **Steps to create a Dynamic Web Application Project**

**_1.Download Eclipse with Java EE_**

You can find the information of how to download here: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

**_2.Create a new Dynamic Web Project_**

Click on File --> New --> Dynamic Web Project

**_3.Add your XML files and the necessary Servlet libraries_**

- [web.xml and spring_mvc_servlet.xml](www.pildorasinformaticas.es/archivos/spring/video27_1.zip) / Add this files in the next folder: src -> main -> webapp -> WEB-INF
- [Javax Servlet Libraries](www.pildorasinformaticas.es/archivos/spring/video27_2.zip) / Add this files in the next folder: src -> main -> webapp -> WEB-INF -> lib

Also create a view folder in the same WEB-INF folder, this to create your JSP views
