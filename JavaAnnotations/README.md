# Annotations in Spring

Annotations in Spring are a way to provide metadata to classes, methods, and variables. This metadata can be used by Spring to perform a number of tasks, such as configuring beans, injecting dependencies, and enabling specific features. Some common annotations in Spring include:

- **`@Component`**: Indicates that a class is a Spring "component" and should be included in the application's component scan.
- **`@Service`**: Indicates that a class is a service and can be used by other components of the application.
- **`@Repository`**: Indicates that a class is a repository and is designed to access storage data.
- **`@Autowired`**: Indicates that a variable should be injected by Spring through dependency injection.
- **`@Value`**: Allows assigning a value to a variable from a property in the application's configuration file.
